## 📞 The Killer Pitch

> "You're meeting 100+ people at [event]. Currently you:
> - Forget names immediately
> - Lose business cards  
> - Can't remember conversations
> - Miss follow-up opportunities
>
> I'll give you superhuman memory for $2,500.
> One closed deal pays for itself 50x."

## 🏆 Why This Beats Other Pivots

❌ **Consumer app**: Months to scale, low ARPU ($10/month)
❌ **API business**: Need developer adoption, slow
