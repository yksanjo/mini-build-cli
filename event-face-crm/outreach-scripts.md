## 📧 Email Outreach Templates

### **Template 1: Event Organizers (Warm Contact)**
**Subject**: Superhuman memory for your next event

**Body**:
Hi [Name],

I noticed you're organizing [Event Name] coming up. I built something that could dramatically improve networking outcomes for your attendees.

It's a facial recognition CRM that gives people "superhuman memory" at events. Attendees can:
- Instantly recognize who they're talking to
- Access LinkedIn profiles in real-time
- Never forget names or conversations
- Get automated follow-up reminders

I'd love to pilot it at your event for free in exchange for a testimonial. If it works well for you, we can discuss a paid arrangement for future events ($2,500-$5,000 depending on size).

Would you be open to a 15-minute demo next week?

Best,
[Your Name]

### **Template 2: Corporate Sales Teams (Cold Outreach)**
**Subject**: Turn every trade show into a lead generation machine

**Body**:
Hi [Name],

I saw [Company] is exhibiting at [Trade Show]. What if your sales team could instantly recognize every prospect who walks up to your booth?

I've built a facial recognition system that:
- Identifies prospects as they approach
- Shows their LinkedIn profile and company info
- Auto-logs interactions for follow-up
- Prioritizes hot leads based on engagement

One client closed a $125,000 deal because they remembered a conversation from 6 months earlier that would have been forgotten otherwise.

The cost is $1,500-$3,000 per event. Would you be interested in a quick demo?

Best,
[Your Name]

### **Template 3: VCs & Investors**
**Subject**: Track 1000+ founders without forgetting a face

**Body**:
Hi [Name],

As a VC meeting hundreds of founders, I know how hard it is to remember everyone. I built a tool that solves this.

It's a facial recognition CRM that helps you:
- Instantly recognize founders at demo days
- Remember past conversations and pitches
- Track relationship history automatically
- Never miss a follow-up opportunity

Several VCs are using it to manage their portfolio relationships. The executive version is $500-$1,000/month.

Would you like to see how it works?

Best,
[Your Name]
